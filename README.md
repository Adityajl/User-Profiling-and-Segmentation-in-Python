## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
- Improve customer service through better understanding of user needs.
- Enhance personalized marketing strategies.
- Provide product recommendations based on user behavior.

## Data Collection
Data was collected from various sources, including:
- User interactions on websites and apps
- Transaction histories
- Social media activity
- Demographic information

## Feature Engineering
New features were created to capture relevant user behaviors and preferences. This involved:
- Aggregating transaction data
- Calculating the frequency of activities
- Extracting patterns from usage logs

## Segmentation Techniques
The following segmentation techniques were applied:
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- DBSCAN

## User Profiles
For each segment identified, user profiles were created summarizing the key characteristics and behaviors of users in that segment. This includes demographic, psychographic, and behavioral attributes.

## Results
The segmentation revealed distinct user groups, allowing for tailored marketing strategies and improved user engagement.

## Graphs and Visualizations
Here are some visualizations that illustrate the results of the user profiling and segmentation:
